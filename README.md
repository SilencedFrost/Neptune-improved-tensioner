Want a better backup for your tensioner in case it breaks?

Too tired of belt rubbing on the ends of extrusions?

Still not tense enough at the end of the movement range?

Or just simply needing an upgrade

This tensioner does it all, being carefully designed to shove as much material into the part, enhancing strenth, it aligns better with the rails on the stock cover, have more tension range, and it uses a proper toothed idler!
